					&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hello there! I'm Alexandra Albu, a passionate
					individual embarking on an exciting transition from a decade-long
					tenure in the dynamic world of hospitality management to the boundless
					realm of front-end development. <br />
					&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With nearly ten years of experience navigating
					the demands of the hospitality sector, predominantly in management
					roles, I've honed my skills in problem-solving, team leadership, and
					delivering exceptional experiences. However, fueled by an insatiable
					curiosity and a desire for a new challenge, I've charted a new course
					toward the world of coding and development. <br />
					&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My journey began with a dedicated nine-month
					immersive course where I delved deep into the foundational languages
					of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, expanding my repertoire to
					include React—a powerful JavaScript library. The experience was
					transformative, and I'm now equipped with a solid understanding of
					these technologies, eager to apply them in creative and innovative
					ways.<br />
					&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As I venture forth into this exciting new
					chapter, I am excited to merge the wealth of knowledge gained from
					both my hospitality background and my newfound expertise in web
					development. My goal is to craft digital experiences that are not just
					visually stunning but also intuitive, efficient, and user-centric.
					<br />
					&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This portfolio is a canvas where I showcase
					not just my technical skills, but a fusion of my past experiences and
					my enthusiasm for creating engaging, user-friendly web interfaces.
